Canvas-wrapper library, *P5*, used in order to visualize a maze generation algorithm as well as a maze solving algorithm in 3D.
Then implemented into a simple React site.

Technologies used: React, Redux, P5

Prim's algorithm implemented for maze generation, A-star implemented for pathfinding / maze solving.
